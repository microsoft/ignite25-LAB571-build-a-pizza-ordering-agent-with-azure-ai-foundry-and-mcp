### Session Description

In this hands-on workshop, you’ll learn to build domain-specific AI agents with Foundry Agent Service. Starting from a simple agent, you’ll add system prompts, custom instructions, and knowledge with RAG. You’ll extend it with tool calling (like a pizza calculator) and connect external services via MCP for live menu and order handling. By the end, you’ll have a working Contoso PizzaBot that can answer questions, recommend pizzas, and manage orders.

### 🧠 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this session, learners will be able to:

- Get hands-on experience with Microsoft Foundry
- Learn how to build intelligent agents step by step
- Understand practical use cases for system prompts, RAG, tool calling, and MCP

### 💻 Technologies Used

1. Microsoft Foundry
1. Visual Studio Code
1. Python

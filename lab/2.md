# Create Your First Agent  

In this chapter, we'll walk through the process of creating your very first AI agent using the **Azure AI Foundry Agent Service**.  
By the end, you'll have a simple agent running locally that you can interact with in real time.  

### Open your Dev Enviroment

Open VSCode, by default VSCode should open the directory c:\agent, if that is not the case follow this:

> [!hint] **Open your project folder**
- Open VSCode
- Click "File"
- Click "Open Folder"
- Select "This Computer\Local Disk (C:)\Agent"
- Click on "Select Folder"
- Click "Yes I trust the authors"


### Login to Azure  

Before you can use the Azure AI Foundry Agent Service, you need to sign in to your Azure subscription.  

> [!hint] If you don't see the terminal opened at the bottom of VSCode, follow this:
- In the top menu click "Terminal"
- Click "New Terminal"

Run the following command and follow the on-screen instructions. Use credentials that have access to your Azure AI Foundry resource:  

```shell
az login --use-device-code
```

#### Use the credentials below
**Username:**    
+++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).Username+++   
**Access Token:**     
+++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).AccessToken+++

NOTE: Once logged in, return to the terminal and see 1 Azure Subscription listed. Press Enter on your keyboard to select the default

### Create a **.env** File  

We'll store secrets (such as your project connection string) in an environment file for security and flexibility.  

1. **Create a file named .env in the root of your project directory.**

2. **Add the following line to the file:**

    ```env
    PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING="https://<your-foundry-resource>.services.ai.azure.com/projects/<your-project-name>"
    ```

Replace `https://<your-foundry-resource>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<your-project-name>` with the actual values from your Azure AI Foundry project.

3. **Where to find your connection string:**

   - Go to the **[Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com/)**
   - Navigate to your project
   - Click on **Overview**
   - The connection string will be displayed on the homepage of your project

> [!hint] Make sure there are **no spaces** around the "=" sign in the ".env" file.


### Create a Basic Agent  

We'll now create a basic Python script that defines and runs an agent.  

- Start by creating a new file called: **agent.py** in the **workshop** folder


#### Add Imports to agent.py  

These imports bring in the Azure SDK, environment handling, and helper classes:  

```python
import os
from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.ai.agents.models import MessageRole, FilePurpose, FunctionTool, FileSearchTool, ToolSet
from dotenv import load_dotenv
```

#### Load the .env File  

Load environment variables into your script by adding this line to `agent.py`:  

```python
load_dotenv(override=True)
```



#### Create an AIProjectClient Instance  

This client connects your script to the Azure AI Foundry service using the connection string and your Azure credentials.  

```python
project_client = AIProjectClient(
    endpoint=os.environ["PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING"],
    credential=DefaultAzureCredential()
)
```



#### Create the Agent  

Now, let's create the agent itself. In this case, it will use the **GPT-4o** model.  

> [!hint] To look-up the name of your deployed model go to: ai.azure.com and Model + endpoints. Here you find the name of your deployed model.

```python
agent = project_client.agents.create_agent(
    model="gpt-4o-XXXXX",
    name="my-agent"
)
print(f"Created agent, ID: {agent.id}")
```


#### Create a Thread  

Agents interact within threads. A thread is like a conversation container that stores all messages exchanged between the user and the agent.  

```python
thread = project_client.agents.threads.create()
print(f"Created thread, ID: {thread.id}")
```


#### Add a Message  

This loop lets you send messages to the agent. Type into the terminal, and the message will be added to the thread.  

```python
try:
    while True:

        # Get the user input
        user_input = input("You: ")

        # Break out of the loop
        if user_input.lower() in ["exit", "quit"]:
            break

        # Add a message to the thread
        message = project_client.agents.messages.create(
            thread_id=thread.id,
            role=MessageRole.USER, 
            content=user_input
    )
```

#### Create and Process an Agent Run  

The agent processes the conversation thread and generates a response.  

```python
        run = project_client.agents.runs.create_and_process(
            thread_id=thread.id, 
            agent_id=agent.id
        )
```

####Fetch All Messages from the Thread  

This retrieves all messages from the thread and prints the agent's most recent response.  

```python
        messages = project_client.agents.messages.list(thread_id=thread.id)
        first_message = next(iter(messages), None) 
        if first_message: 
            print(next((item["text"]["value"] for item in first_message.content if item.get("type") == "text"), "")) 
```

#### Delete the Agent When Done  

Once you're finished, clean up by deleting the agent:  

```python
finally:
    # Clean up the agent when done
    project_client.agents.delete_agent(agent.id)
    print("Deleted agent")
```

Add this code to delete the agent outside of the while True-loop. Otherwise the agent will be deleted immediately after your first interaction.



### Run the Agent  

Finally, run the Python script:  

```shell
python agent.py
```

You can now chat with your agent directly in the terminal. Type `exit` or `quit` to stop the conversation.  


### Recap  

In this chapter, you have:  

- Logged in to Azure  
- Retrieved a connection string  
- Separated secrets from code using ".env"  
- Created a basic agent with the Azure AI Foundry Agent Service  
- Started a conversation with a **GPT-4o** model  
- Cleaned up by deleting the agent when done  


### Final code sample

```python
import os
from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.ai.agents.models import MessageRole, FilePurpose, FunctionTool, FileSearchTool, ToolSet
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv(override=True)

project_client = AIProjectClient(
    endpoint=os.environ["PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING"],
    credential=DefaultAzureCredential()
)

agent = project_client.agents.create_agent(
    model="gpt-4o",
    name="my-agent"
)
print(f"Created agent, ID: {agent.id}")

thread = project_client.agents.threads.create()
print(f"Created thread, ID: {thread.id}")

try:
    while True:
        # Get the user input
        user_input = input("You: ")

        # Break out of the loop
        if user_input.lower() in ["exit", "quit"]:
            break

        # Add a message to the thread
        message = project_client.agents.messages.create(
            thread_id=thread.id,
            role=MessageRole.USER,
            content=user_input
        )

        # Process the agent run
        run = project_client.agents.runs.create_and_process(
            thread_id=thread.id,
            agent_id=agent.id
        )

        # List messages and print the first text response from the agent
        messages = project_client.agents.messages.list(thread_id=thread.id)
        first_message = next(iter(messages), None)
        if first_message:
            print(next((item["text"]["value"] for item in first_message.content if item.get("type") == "text"), "")) 
finally:
    # Clean up the agent when done
    project_client.agents.delete_agent(agent.id)
    print("Deleted agent")
```

# Integrating MCP (Model Context Protocol)

In earlier chapters, your agent learned to follow instructions, ground itself in your own data using **File Search (RAG)**, and call custom **tools**.  

In this final chapter, we'll connect your agent to a live **MCP server** - giving it access to **external capabilities** like live menus, toppings, and order management through a standard, secure protocol.


## What Is MCP and Why Use It?

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is an open standard for connecting AI agents to external tools, data sources, and services through interoperable **MCP servers**.  
Instead of integrating with individual APIs, you connect once to an MCP server and automatically gain access to all the tools that server exposes.

### Benefits of MCP

- 🧩 **Interoperability:** a universal way to expose tools from any service to any MCP-aware agent.  
- 🔐 **Security & governance:** centrally manage access and tool permissions.  
- ⚙️ **Scalability:** add or update server tools without changing your agent code.  
- 🧠 **Simplicity:** keep integrations and business logic in the server; keep your agent focused on reasoning.


## Install the Azure AI Agents SDK (with MCP support)

First, make sure you have the latest SDK version that supports MCP integration.

```bash
pip install "azure-ai-agents>=1.2.0b5"
```

Then, update your imports in **agent.py** to include MCP-related classes and utilities:

```python
from azure.ai.agents.models import McpTool, ToolApproval, ThreadRun, RequiredMcpToolCall, RunHandler
import time
from typing import Any
```

Your full import section should now look like this:

```python
import os
import time
from typing import Any
from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.ai.agents.models import (
    MessageRole, FilePurpose, FunctionTool, FileSearchTool, ToolSet,
    McpTool, ToolApproval, ThreadRun, RequiredMcpToolCall, RunHandler
)
from tools import calculate_pizza_for_people
from dotenv import load_dotenv
```


## The Contoso Pizza MCP Server

For Contoso Pizza, the MCP server exposes APIs for:
- 🧀 **Pizzas:** available menu items and prices  
- 🍅 **Toppings:** categories, availability, and details  
- 📦 **Orders:** create, view, and cancel customer orders  

You'll connect your agent to this server and grant it **explicit permission** to use a curated list of tools for these operations.


## Create and Add the MCP Tool

You'll define the **MCP Tool** right before creating your **ToolSet**, alongside other tools (like File Search or the Pizza Calculator).

### Add the MCP Tool

```python
# Add MCP tool so the agent can call Contoso Pizza microservices
mcp_tool = McpTool(
    server_label="contoso_pizza",
    server_url="@lab.Variable(pizza-mcp)",
    allowed_tools=[
        "get_pizzas",
        "get_pizza_by_id",
        "get_toppings",
        "get_topping_by_id",
        "get_topping_categories",
        "get_orders",
        "get_order_by_id",
        "place_order",
        "delete_order_by_id",
    ],
)
mcp_tool.set_approval_mode("never")
```

Then, add it to the toolset:

```python
toolset.add(mcp_tool)
```

### Parameters Explained

| Parameter | Description |
| -- | -- |
| **server_label** | A human-readable name for logs and debugging. |
| **server_url** | The MCP server endpoint. |
| **allowed_tools** | A whitelist of MCP tools your agent can call. |
| **approval_mode** | Defines whether calls require manual approval (`"never"` disables prompts). |


>[hint!] In production, use more restrictive approval modes and scoped tool access.


## Handling Tool Approvals

When the agent calls an MCP tool, you can intercept and approve these calls dynamically.  
This gives you visibility and fine-grained control over what's executed.

For this we will create a **custom run handler**:

```python
# Custom RunHandler to approve MCP tool calls
class MyRunHandler(RunHandler):
    def submit_mcp_tool_approval(
        self, *, run: ThreadRun, tool_call: RequiredMcpToolCall, **kwargs: Any
    ) -> ToolApproval:
        print(f"[RunHandler] Approving MCP tool call: {tool_call.id} for tool: {tool_call.name}")
        return ToolApproval(
            tool_call_id=tool_call.id,
            approve=True,
            headers=mcp_tool.headers,
        )
```

> This is added **after** defining and enabling the toolset, but **before** creating the agent.


Then, pass the handler when running the agent:

```python
run = project_client.agents.runs.create_and_process(
    thread_id=thread.id,
    agent_id=agent.id,
    run_handler=MyRunHandler()  # Enables controlled MCP approvals
)
```


>[hint!] 🧠 Think of this as a middleware that intercepts all remote tool calls for logging, auditing, or dynamic security rules.


## Add a User ID

To place orders, the agent must identify the customer.

1. **Get your User ID**  
   Open a new browser tab in Edge and navigate to:  +++@lab.Variable(pizza-registration)+++.   

2. **Click on log in with Microsoft**
    
    You can login with:  
   	**Username:**       
	+++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).Username+++   
	**Access Token:**     
	+++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).AccessToken+++

3. You will get a **permissions requested** pop up. Click on **Accept** then on **Grant Consent** on the following page

4. **Copy the resulting User ID before leaving the page!**
   
5. Navigate back to VSCode to **update your instructions.txt** with your user details or pass the GUID in chat.

```txt
## User details:
Name: <YOUR NAME>
UserId: <YOUR USER GUID>
```

>[note!] The name will be +++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).Username+++, while the UserId will be the ID you copied on step 4.

6. (Optional) View your order dashboard: 
 	Open a new browser tab in Edge and navigate to:  +++@lab.Variable(pizza-dashboard)+++. 

    This dashboard will showcase a live-feed of orders as you run the agent. If you have time, you should come back to monitor the orders after you have interacted with your agent.


## Trying It Out

Now it's time to test your connected agent!  
Run the agent and try out these prompts:

```
Show me the available pizzas.
```

```
What is the price for a pizza hawai?
```

```
Place an order for 2 large pepperoni pizzas.
```

The agent will automatically call the appropriate MCP tools, retrieve data from the live Contoso Pizza API, and respond conversationally - following your **instructions.txt** rules (e.g., tone, local currency, and time zone conversions).


## Best Practices for MCP Integration

- 🔒 **Principle of least privilege:** only allow tools the agent truly needs.  
- 📜 **Observability:** log all tool calls for traceability and debugging.  
- 🔁 **Resilience:** handle connection errors gracefully and retry failed tool calls.  
- 🧩 **Versioning:** pin MCP server versions to prevent breaking changes.  
- 👩‍💼 **Human-in-the-loop:** use approval modes for sensitive actions (like order placement).



## Recap

In this chapter, you:  
- Learned what **MCP** is and why it matters for scalable agent design.  
- Installed the updated **Azure AI Agents SDK** with MCP support.  
- Connected your agent to the **Contoso Pizza MCP Server**.  
- Implemented a **custom run handler** for tool approvals.  
- Tested real-time integration with menu, toppings, and order tools.  

🎉 **Congratulations - you've completed the workshop!**  
Your agent can now:  
✅ Follow system instructions  
✅ Access and reason over private data (RAG)  
✅ Call custom tools  
✅ Interact with live services via MCP
